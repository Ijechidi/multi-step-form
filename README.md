# Multi-Step Form
This project demonstrates a multi-step form built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The form consists of three steps: Personal Details, Account Details, and Confirmation. The form transitions between steps, validates input fields, and displays a success message upon successful submission.

### Project Structure
###### index.html: Contains the structure of the multi-step form.
###### style.css: Provides styling for the form, including background image, glass effect, and animations.
###### index.js: Manages the form's functionality, including step transitions and validation.
#### Features
###### Multi-Step Form: Users navigate through three steps of the form.
###### Validation: Ensures all required fields are filled before proceeding.
###### Responsive Design: The form is centered on the page with a transparent glass effect.
###### Animations: Smooth transitions between form steps.
###### Success Message: Displays a success message upon form submission.

### How It Works
##### Step Navigation: The next-btn and prev-btn buttons navigate through the steps of the form. The active class is toggled to show and hide form steps.
##### Validation: Before moving to the next step, the validateStep function checks if all required fields in the current step are filled.
##### Success Message: Upon successful form submission, a success message is displayed.
